The following is a report on the work I conducted at UPMEM during my apprenticeship with the Campus Num√©rique In The Alps.

A point has been reached in Machine Learning where the ubiquitousness of graphics cards as hardware accelerators has become a problem. An environmental problem, as the focus has been mostly on performances rather than power savings ; and a supply problem, as the hardware shortage in the past years has crippled entire industries. A few contenders have emerged as alternatives to graphics cards, and UPMEM technology is one of those.

In this report, I will explain the UPMEM technology and demonstrate that it undeniably has great potential for Machine Learning applications.
